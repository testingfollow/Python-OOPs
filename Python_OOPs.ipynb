Its purpose is to provide a detailed and often reconstructible representation, primarily for debugging and development. The output of __repr__ should ideally be a valid Python expression that could recreate the object. When you use repr() or inspect an object in an interactive interpreter (without explicitly calling print()), Python calls its __repr__ method. If __str__ is not defined for a class, __repr__ will be used as a fallback for print() and str()."
